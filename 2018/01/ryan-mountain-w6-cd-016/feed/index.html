					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ke6mt.us/2018/01/ryan-mountain-w6-cd-016/#comment-38&quot;&gt;John Leonardelli&lt;/a&gt;.

Thanks! 

Yeah, I&#039;m not so sure there were any hams in range, let alone on 52.  This park really is in the middle of nowhere. 

You know, I think I mentioned something similar to your &quot;KOS&quot; idea to my wife. Haha!

73,

					<description><![CDATA[Rex, another great summit view and activations. I am glad the xyl supports and shares the SOTA activities. Here is a great example of no one monitoring 52 that years and years ago was standard practice. So HF cw becomes critical. Your wife should register for KOS or Kindles on Summits where the device sends a GPS to AWS and tracks what height above sea level  the book is read. John ve3ips.]]></description>
