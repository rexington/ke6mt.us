Don&#039;t know if you&#039;re a podcast listener, but if you haven&#039;t yet, check out that DitDit.fm podcast. Definitely a winner!]]></description>

I think I have tried just about all of the apps and freeware. I&#039;ve got the letters, numbers, comma, period, slash, equal, question....but like I said, the &quot;slang&quot; for lack of a better term eludes me. I just need to start answering CQ calls, or start calling. Somewhat fearful of getting caught up in a long rag chew, or not knowing the protocol, etc.]]></description>

I can totally relate!  lcwo.net has been a bit of a pain for me, too.  I mainly used Morse Toad to get the hang of the letters and numbers. Once I somewhat got the hang of the characters, I listened to some QSOs, and I immediately started wondering what the heck &quot;ES&quot; and &quot;BTU&quot; and several other things meant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m in the same boat! I&#039;ve been using an MFJ paddle I picked up a month ago, I also listen and attempt to copy on pad with pencil. I am registered for the CW Academy, but they filled up fast and when I signed up last April, I got in the Jan 2018 class. I use LCWO.net for practice a couple times a day, but this is not as easy as some think (at least for me). I have used my key for one QSO, arranged and coordinated via FB Messenger with another FB user. I hear a lot of acronyms, shortcuts, etc on the air and I am worried that I don&#039;t know the &quot;jargon&quot;, or the proper procedure....excuses really....de K4SFC]]></description>
