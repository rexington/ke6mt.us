For sure. I definitely got through the &quot;double Ls&quot; and now my sending is getting pretty good.  I still struggle with anything more than a quick exchange of info, but I&#039;m getting there! I suppose I ought to post an update on my CW progress of late.

Do not dispair. Just keep at it. I just started CWA level 1, but have had some experience before. The characters at 20+ require development of ear-hand coordination, especially for h, 5, 4, 6 (any character with a string of dits). Also, try sending a series of characters (words are better) with a high percentage of Ls for example. Slow the keyer down to where you are nearly 100% accurate, then dial it up 1 or 2wpm. Once you are hitting all your Ls (or whatever you are working on) at nearly 100%, bump it up another couple. Also try to hear the sound of the entire character. It is necessary at the higher speeds -impossible to actually count dits that gay fast. Do a lot of E I S H 5 and mix them around. Use Morse Trainer to send them accurately until you get the &quot;feel&quot; of the dit count on your head. Then just do the sending practice get the early coordination to the speed you want to have.

Hope that is helpful.
You can call me if you need to.

					<description><![CDATA[Good stuff! I just started the level one training as well! Same feeling on the CW Academy too. Prior to the classes, I was working on sending at about 10-12 wpm. We are sending (and head copying) the characters at 20wpm and that is a challenge using the iambic keyer after learning to send at 12...lol...always seem to send either one less, or one extra dit, or dah...lol.]]></description>
